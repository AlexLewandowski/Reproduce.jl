What were my hyper-parameter settings again?

A framework for managing hyper-parameter settings for machine learning experiments based on LiteTrace from Borealis.

## What is this?

This repository is for making sure all your experiments are reproducible.



## What's next.

The goal is to make a convenient framework for data analysis for experiments in ML/RL. The goal is to create something like [mlflow](mlflow.org) for Julia. It might be worthwhile to actually take advantage of the mlflow framework, or even a similar framework for the future.
